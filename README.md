The R-CNN architecture is utilized for detecting and localizing 
objects within images. It operates by proposing potential object regions, extracting 
features from those regions, and then classifying and refining the bounding boxes. 
By incorporating R-CNN into the proposed system, the project gains the ability to 
accurately detect vehicles and map them to parking spots. This enhances the 
overall efficiency of parking lot management and security by providing reliable 
vehicle detection and mapping capabilities.
